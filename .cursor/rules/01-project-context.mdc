# Project Configuration

## 1. Project Overview
- Project Name: Alexa Shopping List MCP Server (Assumed Name)
- Brief Description: Provides a FastMCP server allowing an LLM to interact with an Alexa shopping list using cookies generated via a Selenium-based login script.
- Repository URL (e.g., GitHub): (Please Add)
- Main Branch Name: (Please Add, e.g., main)
- Website / Deployment URL: N/A

## 2. Technical Stack
# List the primary technologies and versions if known.
- Programming Language(s): Python 3.x
- Frontend Framework/Libraries: N/A
- Backend Framework/Libraries: FastMCP
- Database(s) & ORM/ODM: N/A
- Authentication Method/Library: Custom Selenium browser login + Cookie persistence (pickle)
- State Management (Frontend): N/A
- UI Component Library: N/A
- Testing Frameworks/Libraries: (Not specified, potentially pytest if tests added)
- Build Tools/Bundlers: N/A
- Package Manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, etc.): pip
- Deployment Platform/Environment: Local machine (for login), FastMCP dev/install environment
- Other Key Libraries/Tools:
    - `requests`: For making HTTP API calls to Alexa.
    - `python-dotenv`: For managing environment variables.
    - `selenium`: For browser automation during login.
    - `webdriver-manager`: For managing WebDriver binaries.

## 3. Project Structure
# Briefly describe the main source code directories and their purpose.
- `/src/alexa_shopping_list`: Core logic for interacting with the Alexa API (config, auth via Selenium, API calls).
- `/src/mcp`: Contains the FastMCP server (`mcp_server.py`) and the dedicated login script (`login.py`).
- `/`: Contains main entrypoint for login (`run.py`), configuration files (`requirements.txt`, `.env`, `.env.example`), and documentation (`README.md`).

## 4. Coding Conventions & Standards
# Specify any enforced or preferred conventions.
- Naming Conventions:
    * Files: snake_case.py
    * Directories: snake_case
    * Variables/Functions: snake_case (PEP 8)
    * Classes/Components: PascalCase (PEP 8)
    * CSS Classes: N/A
- Formatting Tool (e.g., Prettier): (Not specified - Recommend Black/Ruff)
- Linter Tool (e.g., ESLint, RuboCop): (Not specified - Recommend Ruff/Flake8/Pylint)
- Code Style Preferences: Follows standard Python PEP 8.
- Path Aliases (e.g., `@/*` -> `src/*`): None specified.
- Commenting Style: Docstrings for public functions/classes, inline comments for clarification.

## 5. Key Abstractions & Patterns
# List any important custom hooks, utility functions, base classes, or design patterns the AI should prioritize using.
- `AppConfig` dataclass (`src/alexa_shopping_list/config.py`): Central configuration object loaded via `load_config()` from `.env`.
- `ensure_authentication` function (`src/alexa_shopping_list/auth.py`): Handles Selenium login flow and cookie persistence.
- `make_authenticated_request` function (`src/alexa_shopping_list/alexa_api.py`): Central function for making authenticated calls to the Alexa API using saved cookies.
- FastMCP Tools (`src/mcp/mcp_server.py`): Use `@mcp.tool()` decorator to expose functionality to the LLM.

## 6. Important Notes or Constraints
# Any other critical information the AI should know? (e.g., performance constraints, specific browser support, accessibility requirements)
- **Authentication is a separate step:** The MCP server (`mcp_server.py`) requires a valid cookie file generated beforehand by running `run.py`. The server itself does not perform the interactive login.
- **Requires Google Chrome:** The Selenium login currently relies on Google Chrome being installed on the host machine where `run.py` is executed.
- **API Endpoints:** Core API endpoints are defined in `src/alexa_shopping_list/alexa_api.py` and were derived from external documentation/analysis.
- **Item Matching:** Tools modifying items (`delete`, `mark_complete`, `mark_incomplete`) primarily match items based on case-insensitive string value comparison.
