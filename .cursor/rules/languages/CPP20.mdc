# C++20/23 Programming Guidelines

## Core Principles & Philosophy
- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization): Manage resources (memory, files, locks, sockets) through objects whose destructors automatically release the resource.
- Value Semantics: Prefer passing and returning objects by value when copying is cheap and makes sense, promoting clarity and avoiding lifetime issues.
- Const Correctness: Use `const` extensively for variables, pointers/references, and member functions that do not modify observable state.
- Type Safety: Leverage the C++ type system. Avoid C-style casts; use C++ casts (`static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`) appropriately and sparingly.
- Standard Library First: Prefer using components from the C++ Standard Library (`std`) over custom implementations or C-style approaches.
- Zero-Overhead Principle: Don't pay for what you don't use. Use language features efficiently.

## Modern C++ Features (C++11/14/17/20/23)
- Use `auto` for type deduction where it improves readability, but use explicit types for clarity in interfaces or complex expressions.
- Range-Based `for` Loops: Use for iterating over containers (`for (const auto& item : container)`).
- Smart Pointers: Use `std::unique_ptr` for unique ownership and `std::shared_ptr` for shared ownership. Avoid raw `new` and `delete` for owning pointers.
- Move Semantics: Understand and utilize move constructors and move assignment operators (often implicitly generated) for efficient resource transfer. Use `std::move` explicitly when transferring ownership.
- Lambdas: Use lambda expressions for inline functions, especially with standard library algorithms.
- `nullptr`: Use `nullptr` instead of `0` or `NULL` for null pointers.
- `enum class`: Prefer strongly-typed, scoped enumerations (`enum class`) over unscoped `enum`.
- Structured Bindings (C++17): Use for unpacking tuples, pairs, or struct/class members (`auto [key, value] = myMap.begin();`).
- `if constexpr` (C++17): Use for compile-time conditional code based on template parameters.
- `std::optional` (C++17): Use for representing optional values, replacing nullable pointers or magic values.
- `std::variant` (C++17): Use for type-safe unions.
- `std::string_view` (C++17): Use for non-owning, read-only views of character sequences, avoiding unnecessary string copies.
- `std::filesystem` (C++17): Use for portable filesystem operations.
- Concepts (C++20): Use to constrain template parameters, improving template error messages and expressing design intent.
- Ranges (C++20): Utilize the ranges library (`std::ranges`) for more composable and expressive algorithms.
- Coroutines (C++20): Use for cooperative multitasking and asynchronous operations (generators, async/await patterns).
- Modules (C++20): Consider using modules for better encapsulation and potentially faster compile times (compiler/build system support varies).
- `std::format` (C++20): Prefer over iostreams or C-style formatting for type-safe and efficient string formatting.
- `std::span` (C++20): Use for non-owning views of contiguous sequences (like arrays, vectors).
- `std::expected` (C++23): Consider for functions that can return either a value or an error, as an alternative to exceptions or `std::optional` + error code.

## Code Style & Organization
- Consistency: Maintain a consistent coding style (naming, formatting, brace style). Use tools like `clang-format` with a defined style (e.g., in `.clang-format`).
- Naming:
    - `PascalCase` or `camelCase` for classes/structs (be consistent).
    - `camelCase` or `snake_case` for functions/methods/variables (be consistent).
    - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants and enum members.
    - `snake_case` for namespaces and file names.
- Namespaces: Use namespaces to avoid naming collisions and organize code logically.
- Header/Source Separation: Separate declarations (`.h`, `.hpp`) from definitions (`.cpp`, `.cxx`). Minimize includes in header files (use forward declarations where possible).
- Includes: Use `#include <header>` for standard/library headers and `#include "path/to/header.h"` for project headers.

## Classes & Structs
- Rule of Zero/Three/Five: If a class manages resources directly (rare with RAII), define or delete the special member functions (copy/move constructor, copy/move assignment, destructor) correctly. Otherwise (Rule of Zero), rely on compiler-generated ones.
- Single Responsibility Principle: Design classes with a single, well-defined purpose.
- Interfaces: Define interfaces using abstract base classes with pure virtual functions or using Concepts (C++20).
- Prefer `struct` for Plain Old Data (POD): Use `struct` when primarily aggregating data with few or no invariants.
- Prefer `class` for Encapsulation/Invariants: Use `class` when enforcing invariants or encapsulating behavior. Default to `private` members.
- Mark Overrides: Use the `override` specifier when overriding virtual functions.
- Mark Finals: Use `final` on classes or virtual functions to prevent further derivation or overriding.

## Error Handling
- Use Exceptions for Exceptional Errors: Throw exceptions for errors that prevent a function from meeting its preconditions, postconditions, or invariants (e.g., out of memory, file not found when required). Catch exceptions by `const&`.
- Use `std::expected` (C++23) or Error Codes/`std::optional` for Expected Failures: For predictable error conditions (e.g., validation failure, resource unavailable but might become available), prefer non-exception mechanisms.
- RAII for Cleanup: Ensure resources are cleaned up automatically, even when exceptions occur, by using RAII wrappers (smart pointers, standard containers, custom RAII classes).

## Memory & Resource Management
- RAII is Key: See Core Principles.
- Smart Pointers: See Modern C++ Features.
- Standard Containers: Prefer `std::vector`, `std::string`, `std::array`, `std::map`, `std::unordered_map`, etc., over manual memory management or C-style arrays/strings.

## Build System & Dependencies
- Use a Standard Build System: CMake is the de facto standard. Meson is another modern option.
- Use a Package Manager: Manage external dependencies using Conan or vcpkg.

## Testing
- Use a Testing Framework: Employ frameworks like Google Test, Catch2, or doctest.
- Unit Tests: Test individual classes and functions in isolation.
- Integration Tests: Test the interaction between components.
- Arrange-Act-Assert: Structure tests clearly.
- Test Doubles: Use mocks, fakes, or stubs where needed to isolate units.

## C++ Programming Guidelines

## Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
- Create necessary types and classes.
- Use Doxygen style comments to document public classes and methods.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- Follow the one-definition rule (ODR).

## Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes and structures.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants and macros.
- Use snake_case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
- Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and ensure correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j, k for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res for request/response parameters

## Functions

- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
- If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
- If it doesn't return anything (void), use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use standard library algorithms (std::for_each, std::transform, std::find, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
- Use lambda functions for simple operations.
- Use named functions for non-simple operations.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or nullptr.
- Reduce function parameters using structs or classes
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return multiple results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

## Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
- Use const for data that doesn't change.
- Use constexpr for compile-time constants.
- Use std::optional for possibly null values.

## Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces as abstract classes or concepts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.
- Use the Rule of Five (or Rule of Zero) for resource management.
- Make member variables private and provide getters/setters where necessary.
- Use const-correctness for member functions.

## Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.
- Use std::optional, std::expected, or error codes for expected failures.

## Memory Management

- Prefer smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr) over raw pointers.
- Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles.
- Avoid memory leaks by proper resource management.
- Use std::vector and other standard containers instead of C-style arrays.

## Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
- Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
- Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
  - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write integration tests for each module.
- Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

## Project Structure

- Use modular architecture
- Organize code into logical directories:
  - include/ for header files
  - src/ for source files
  - test/ for test files
  - lib/ for libraries
  - doc/ for documentation
- Use CMake or similar build system.
- Separate interface (.h) from implementation (.cpp).
- Use namespaces to organize code logically.
- Create a core namespace for foundational components.
- Create a utils namespace for utility functions.

## Standard Library

- Use the C++ Standard Library whenever possible.
- Prefer std::string over C-style strings.
- Use std::vector, std::map, std::unordered_map, etc. for collections.
- Use std::optional, std::variant, std::any for modern type safety.
- Use std::filesystem for file operations.
- Use std::chrono for time-related operations.

## Concurrency

- Use std::thread, std::mutex, std::lock_guard for thread safety.
- Prefer task-based parallelism over thread-based parallelism.
- Use std::atomic for atomic operations.
- Avoid data races by proper synchronization.
- Use thread-safe data structures when necessary.
