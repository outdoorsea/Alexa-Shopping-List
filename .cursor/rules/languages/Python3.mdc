# Python 3 Best Practices

## Project Structure & Packaging
- Prefer `pyproject.toml` for project metadata, build system configuration, and dependencies. Use `requirements.txt` as a fallback or for specific environment pinning.
- Use a `src`-layout: Place main application code inside a `src/your_package_name/` directory.
- Place tests in a `tests/` directory parallel to `src/`.
- Keep configuration separate (e.g., in environment variables, `.env` files loaded via appropriate libraries, or dedicated config files/modules).
- Structure code logically by feature or domain within the `src` directory.

## Code Style & Formatting
- Adhere strictly to PEP 8.
- Use an automated code formatter for consistency.
- Use an import sorting tool for consistent import ordering.
- Use a linter (identifying style issues, potential bugs, complexity).
- Configure these tools appropriately (e.g., in `pyproject.toml`).
- Naming Conventions (PEP 8):
  - `snake_case` for functions, methods, variables, and modules.
  - `PascalCase` (or `CapWords`) for classes.
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
  - Leading underscore (`_`) for internal/protected attributes/methods.
  - Double leading underscore (`__`) for name mangling (use sparingly).

## Language Features & Idioms
- Use f-strings for string formatting (`f"Value is {variable}"`). Avoid older formatting methods.
- Use context managers (`with` statement) for resources that need cleanup (files, network connections, locks, database connections). Implement `__enter__` and `__exit__` for custom context managers or use `contextlib`.
- Use list/dict/set comprehensions and generator expressions for concise and efficient creation of sequences.
- Leverage built-in functions and modules (e.g., `itertools`, `collections`, `functools`) where appropriate.
- Prefer exceptions for error handling over returning error codes or `None` for exceptional situations.
- Use `pathlib` for object-oriented filesystem path manipulation instead of `os.path`.
- Use `enum.Enum` for enumerations.
- Use `dataclasses` (or similar libraries) for classes primarily holding data.

## Type Hints (PEP 484+)
- Add type hints to all function/method signatures (parameters and return values) and key variables.
- Use standard types from the `typing` module (`List`, `Dict`, `Tuple`, `Set`, `Optional`, `Union`, `Any`, `Callable`, etc.). Use built-in generics (e.g., `list[int]`, `dict[str, int]`) in Python 3.9+.
- Use `TypeAlias` (Python 3.10+) or assignment for complex type definitions.
- Use `TypeVar` for generic functions and classes.
- Define custom data structures using `TypedDict` or dataclass-like structures.
- Use `typing.Protocol` for structural subtyping (duck typing interfaces).
- Run a static type checker as part of CI/linting.

## Object-Oriented Programming
- Follow SOLID principles where applicable.
- Use composition over inheritance when appropriate.
- Use properties (`@property`) for accessing attributes when logic is involved, but prefer simple public attributes otherwise.
- Understand and use dunder methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.) appropriately.

## Error Handling & Exceptions
- Be specific when catching exceptions (`except SpecificError:` instead of `except Exception:` or bare `except:`).
- Define custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception` for application-specific errors.
- Use `try...except...else...finally` blocks effectively.
  - `else` block runs if no exception occurred in `try`.
  - `finally` block always runs for cleanup.
- Log exceptions with tracebacks before re-raising or handling.

## Testing
- Use a standard testing framework
- Organize tests mirroring the `src` structure within the `tests/` directory.
- Write clear, focused test functions (unit, integration).
- Use framework features (e.g., fixtures) for test setup and teardown.
- Use mocking libraries to isolate dependencies.
- Measure test coverage using appropriate tools and aim for meaningful coverage.
- Parameterize tests to test multiple scenarios efficiently.

## Virtual Environments & Dependency Management
- Always use virtual environments (`venv` module is built-in). Avoid installing packages globally.
- Manage dependencies using `pip` with `pyproject.toml` or dedicated dependency management tools.
- Pin dependencies (specify exact versions) for reproducible builds, especially for applications. Use lock files or pinned requirements files.
- Separate development dependencies from production dependencies.
- Regularly update dependencies and check for security vulnerabilities using appropriate tools.

## Documentation
- Write clear docstrings for all public modules, classes, functions, and methods, following a standard format.
- Consider using tools to generate documentation from docstrings.
- Maintain an informative `README.md` file.
- Add comments to explain *why* non-obvious code exists, not *what* it does.

## Security
- Never trust user input. Validate and sanitize all external data.
- Be aware of common vulnerabilities (injection attacks, insecure deserialization, etc.). Refer to OWASP Top 10.
- Handle secrets securely (environment variables, secrets management tools). Do not commit secrets to version control.
- Use linters and security scanning tools to identify potential issues.

## Performance
- Profile code using standard Python profiling tools to identify bottlenecks before optimizing.
- Understand the time complexity of algorithms and data structures used.
- Use appropriate data structures (`dict`/`set` for lookups, `list` for sequences, etc.).
- Consider caching strategies where appropriate.

## Web Framework Specific (If Applicable)
- *If using a web framework:* Apply framework-specific best practices (e.g., application factory pattern, blueprint/router organization).
- *If using an ORM:* Define models clearly, manage sessions/connections correctly, implement migrations.
- *If applicable:* Implement proper authentication/authorization mechanisms.
- *If applicable:* Use template engines securely (e.g., enable autoescaping).
- *If applicable:* Implement CSRF protection for web forms.
