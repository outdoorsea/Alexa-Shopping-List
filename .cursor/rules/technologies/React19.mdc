# React Best Practices

## Component Design & Structure
- Prefer functional components with Hooks over class components.
- Keep components small, focused, and reusable.
- Use composition to combine components. Avoid inheritance patterns.
- Define prop types clearly (using TypeScript interfaces/types is recommended).
- Split large components into smaller, more manageable ones.
- Colocate related components, hooks, and types where appropriate.

## Hooks
- Strictly follow the Rules of Hooks (only call hooks at the top level, only from React functions).
- Extract reusable stateful logic into custom Hooks.
- Keep custom Hooks focused on a single concern.
- Provide exhaustive and correct dependency arrays for `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`.
- Implement cleanup logic in `useEffect` for subscriptions, timers, or other resources that need disposal.

## State Management
- Use `useState` for simple, local component state.
- Use `useReducer` for more complex state logic involving multiple sub-values or state transitions.
- Use React Context API (`useContext`) for sharing state that needs to be accessible by many components at different levels, but be mindful of performance implications.
- Keep state as close as possible to where it's needed.
- Avoid excessive prop drilling by lifting state up or using Context/state management solutions.
- Evaluate the need for external state management libraries carefully; often, built-in hooks and composition suffice.

## Performance Optimization
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders:
    - Use `React.memo` to memoize components based on prop equality.
    - Use `useCallback` to memoize callback functions passed to optimized child components.
    - Use `useMemo` to memoize expensive calculations.
- Apply memoization judiciously; profile first to identify actual bottlenecks.
- Use proper `key` props when rendering lists to help React identify items.
- Use code splitting (e.g., `React.lazy` with Suspense) to lazy-load components not needed immediately.
- Profile component render performance using React DevTools.

## Forms
- Primarily use controlled components where React state drives the form input values.
- Implement client-side validation for immediate feedback, but always ensure server-side validation.
- Clearly indicate form submission states (loading, success, error) to the user.
- Consider using form management libraries for complex forms with intricate validation or state logic, but understand the trade-offs.
- Ensure forms are accessible (proper labels, input types, focus management, error association).

## Error Handling
- Use Error Boundaries (class components with `getDerivedStateFromError` or `componentDidCatch`) to catch rendering errors in their child component tree.
- Implement proper error handling for asynchronous operations (e.g., data fetching) within components or hooks.
- Display user-friendly error messages and provide appropriate fallback UI within Error Boundaries.
- Log errors using appropriate logging services or mechanisms.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions and complex custom Hooks.
- Write integration tests for components and their interactions using a testing library that encourages testing user behavior.
- Test component rendering with different props and states.
- Test user interactions (clicks, input changes, form submissions).
- Test edge cases and error scenarios.
- Use mocking for external dependencies (APIs, modules).

## Accessibility (a11y)
- Use semantic HTML elements whenever possible.
- Implement appropriate ARIA attributes when semantic HTML is insufficient to convey roles, states, or properties.
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable and focusable, with clear focus indicators.
- Test color contrast and ensure text is legible.
- Provide meaningful `alt` text for images or mark them as decorative if appropriate.
- Consider testing with screen readers and automated accessibility checking tools.

## Code Organization & Conventions
- Group related files (component, styles, tests, hooks) together by feature or component.
- Use clear and consistent file naming conventions (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`, `useUserData.ts`).
- Use absolute or path-aliased imports for better maintainability over deep relative imports.
- Document complex component logic, non-obvious props, or custom hooks.
