# Node.js and Express.js Best Practices

## Module System (ESM vs CommonJS)
- Prefer ES Modules (ESM) for new projects (`import`/`export`). Set `"type": "module"` in `package.json`.
- Use `.mjs` extension for ESM files if `package.json` lacks `"type": "module"` or is set to `"commonjs"`.
- Use `.cjs` extension for CommonJS files if `package.json` is set to `"type": "module"`.
- Be explicit: Always include the `"type"` field in `package.json` (`"module"` or `"commonjs"`).
- Use full file paths with extensions in `import` statements (e.g., `import { func } from './utils.js';`). Directory imports (e.g., `./utils`) might behave differently between CJS and ESM.
- Understand differences: ESM does not have `require`, `module.exports`, `__filename`, or `__dirname`. Use `import.meta.url`, `import.meta.resolve`, and utilities like `path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))` instead.
- For interoperability:
    - You can `import` CommonJS modules from ESM.
    - You *cannot* directly `require()` ES Modules from CommonJS. Use dynamic `import()` instead.

## `package.json` Configuration
- Define package entry points using the `"exports"` field (Node.js 12+). This offers more control than `"main"` and allows defining subpath exports and conditional exports (e.g., different entries for `require` vs `import`).
    - Example: `{ "exports": { ".": "./index.js", "./utils": "./lib/utils.js" } }`
    - Conditional Example: `{ "exports": { "import": "./index.mjs", "require": "./index.cjs" } }`
- All paths in `"exports"` must start with `./`.
- Use `"imports"` (Node.js 14.6+) for internal package mappings (e.g., `#utils` -> `./lib/utils.js`).
- Keep dependencies (`dependencies`, `devDependencies`) up-to-date and remove unused ones.
- Specify the Node.js engine version(s) required: `"engines": { "node": ">=18.0.0" }`.

## Project Structure
- Organize code logically by feature or domain (e.g., `/src/users`, `/src/products`).
- Separate routes, controllers/services, models, utilities, and configuration.
- Example Structure:
    - `/src`
        - `/api` (or `/routes`): Express route definitions
        - `/controllers` (or `/services`): Business logic
        - `/models`: Data access layer / schemas
        - `/middleware`: Express middleware
        - `/config`: Application configuration
        - `/utils`: Shared utility functions
    - `/tests`
    - `server.js` (or `index.js`, `app.js`): Main application entry point
    - `package.json`
    - `.env`
    - `Dockerfile` (if applicable)

## Asynchronous Operations
- Use `async/await` for all asynchronous operations (I/O, database calls, promises).
- Avoid blocking the event loop. Use worker threads (`worker_threads`) for CPU-intensive tasks.
- Properly handle promise rejections using `try...catch` with `async/await` or `.catch()` with promises.
- Beware of unhandled promise rejections; they can crash the application. Use `process.on('unhandledRejection', ...)` for logging/cleanup if necessary, but prefer explicit handling.

## Error Handling
- Implement a centralized error handling middleware in Express (must have 4 arguments: `(err, req, res, next)`).
- Use custom error classes extending `Error` for specific error types (e.g., `NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`).
- Avoid using `throw` with non-Error objects (e.g., strings).
- Gracefully handle operational errors (e.g., invalid input, DB connection failed) and distinguish them from programmer errors (bugs).
- Shut down gracefully on unrecoverable errors, logging the error details.

## Express Setup & Middleware
- Use standard security middleware for tasks like setting security headers, enabling CORS (configure appropriately), and rate limiting.
- Use middleware for request validation (schema validation libraries are recommended). Validate input *before* processing.
- Structure middleware logically; apply global middleware first, then route-specific middleware.
- Serve static files using `express.static()`, typically placed behind authentication/authorization middleware if needed.

## API Design (RESTful)
- Use standard HTTP methods correctly (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500, etc.).
- Implement clear and consistent API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/users`).
- Use consistent response formats (e.g., `{ "data": ..., "error": null }` or `{ "data": null, "error": { "message": ... } }`).
- Document APIs using standards like OpenAPI (Swagger). Consider tools that generate or serve Swagger UI.

## Database Integration
- Choose an appropriate data access strategy (ORM, query builder, or direct driver usage) based on project needs.
- Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.
- Implement database migrations for schema changes using appropriate tools or ORM features.
- Handle transactions properly for operations requiring multiple atomic steps.
- Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection if not using an ORM/ODM that handles it automatically.

## Security
- Hash passwords securely using strong, modern algorithms.
- Implement robust authentication and authorization (role-based access control) using established patterns and libraries.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs (request bodies, query params, headers).
- Protect against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, injection attacks).
- Keep dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `npm audit fix`).

## Logging & Monitoring
- Use a structured logging library. Avoid `console.log` in production.
- Log meaningful information, including request IDs for tracing.
- Implement application monitoring and alerting using appropriate tools/services.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for individual functions/modules using a suitable testing framework.
- Write integration tests for API endpoints and interactions between components.
- Use mocking/stubbing libraries to isolate units during testing.
- Aim for good test coverage, especially for critical paths.

## Deployment & Process Management
- Use environment variables for configuration (database URLs, API keys, etc.). Consider libraries for loading `.env` files in local development.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- Use a process manager to handle restarts and manage Node.js processes in production. Use appropriate tools for watching changes during development.
- Handle process signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM) for graceful shutdown (close database connections, finish requests).
