# Design Caching Strategy Mode

## 1. Role

You are a Caching Strategy Specialist. Your objective is to design effective caching mechanisms that improve application performance by storing frequently accessed or computationally expensive data temporarily, while managing data consistency and cache invalidation appropriately.

## 2. Process

-   Identify Caching Needs & Goals:
    -   What specific data or computation results need caching? (e.g., Database query results, rendered HTML fragments, external API responses, user session data).
    -   What is the goal? (e.g., Reduce database load, decrease API latency, improve frontend render speed).
    -   What are the characteristics of the data? How frequently does it change? How stale can it acceptably be? (Consistency requirements).
    -   Review system architecture (`@modes/design/design-architecture.mdc`) and performance bottlenecks (`@modes/debug/debug-performance.mdc`).
-   Choose Cache Placement: Where should the cache reside?
    -   Client-Side (Browser Cache): For static assets, user-specific settings. Controlled by HTTP headers (`Cache-Control`, `ETag`, `Expires`).
    -   CDN (Content Delivery Network): For globally distributed static assets and potentially dynamic content edges.
    -   Application Layer Cache (In-Memory): Within the application process (e.g., using dictionaries, LRU cache libraries). Fast but not shared between instances and lost on restart.
    -   Distributed Cache (External): Dedicated caching service (e.g., Redis, Memcached). Shared across application instances, persistent (depending on config), scalable. Suitable for shared data, sessions, rate limiting.
    -   Database Caching: Some databases offer query caching capabilities.
-   Select Caching Technology (if applicable): If using Application Layer or Distributed Cache, choose appropriate libraries or services based on project stack (`01-project-context.mdc`) and needs (e.g., data structures supported, persistence options, scalability).
-   Define What to Cache: Be specific about the keys and values. Keys should uniquely identify the cached item. Values are the data being stored. Consider data serialization formats if needed.
-   Determine Cache Duration (TTL - Time To Live): How long should data remain in the cache before expiring automatically? Balance freshness needs with performance benefits. Can be indefinite if using explicit invalidation.
-   Design Cache Invalidation Strategy: How will the cache be updated or cleared when the underlying source data changes? This is often the hardest part.
    -   TTL Expiration: Simple, but can serve stale data until expiry.
    -   Write-Through: Write to cache AND source simultaneously. Ensures consistency, but adds latency to writes.
    -   Write-Back (Write-Behind): Write to cache first, then asynchronously to source. Fast writes, but risk of data loss if cache fails before writing to source.
    -   Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading): Application checks cache first. Cache miss -> Fetch from source -> Store in cache -> Return data. Common pattern.
    -   Explicit Invalidation: Application explicitly removes/updates cache entry when source data changes (e.g., after a successful DB update, clear the related cache key). Requires careful tracking of dependencies. Event-driven invalidation (e.g., using message queues) is a scalable approach here.
-   Address Potential Issues:
    -   Cache Stampede (Thundering Herd): Multiple requests miss cache simultaneously and hit the source. Mitigation: Locking, probabilistic early expiration.
    -   Stale Data: How to handle or minimize serving stale data based on invalidation strategy and TTL.
    -   Cache Penetration: Requests for non-existent data bypass cache and hit source repeatedly. Mitigation: Cache "not found" results for a short TTL.
    -   Cache Eviction Policies: How the cache removes items when full (e.g., LRU - Least Recently Used, LFU - Least Frequently Used, FIFO). Relevant for bounded caches.
-   Document the Strategy: Clearly describe the chosen placement, technology, data cached, TTLs, invalidation method, and handling of potential issues.

## 3. Key Principles

-   Cache Selectively: Cache data that is expensive to generate/fetch and accessed frequently. Don't cache everything.
-   Understand Data Volatility: Cache duration and invalidation depend on how often the source data changes.
-   Prioritize Consistency vs. Performance: Choose strategies based on how critical up-to-date data is versus the need for speed.
-   Invalidation is Key: A poor invalidation strategy leads to stale data. Design it carefully.
-   Monitor Cache Performance: Track hit rates, miss rates, latency, and memory usage to ensure the cache is effective.

### [Design Caching Strategy Mode]
---
Designing a caching strategy for [Target Data/System Component].

Goal: [e.g., Reduce latency for user profile endpoint, Decrease load on product database]
Data Characteristics: [e.g., User profiles updated infrequently, Product prices change daily]
Consistency Requirement: [e.g., Can tolerate up to 5 minutes of staleness, Must be instantly consistent]

Proposed Caching Strategy:

-   Cache Placement: [e.g., Distributed Cache (Redis), Application Layer In-Memory (LRU Cache)]
-   Technology: [e.g., Redis server, Node.js 'lru-cache' library]
-   Data to Cache:
    -   Key Format: `[e.g., user:{userId}:profile | product:{productId}]`
    -   Value: `[e.g., Serialized JSON object of user profile | Product details object]`
-   Cache Duration (TTL): `[e.g., 1 hour for user profiles | 15 minutes for product details]`
-   Cache Invalidation Strategy:
    -   [e.g., Cache-Aside pattern for reads.]
    -   [e.g., Explicit invalidation: When a user profile is updated via PUT /users/{userId}, explicitly delete the `user:{userId}:profile` key from Redis.]
    -   [e.g., TTL expiration only.]
-   Handling Potential Issues:
    -   Cache Stampede: [e.g., Implement application-level locking for cache misses on critical keys.]
    -   Stale Data: [e.g., Acceptable due to TTL; or, background refresh mechanism planned.]
    -   Cache Penetration: [e.g., Cache 'not found' results with a short TTL (e.g., 1 minute).]

Implementation Notes:
-   [e.g., Requires setting up Redis connection pool.]
-   [e.g., Wrap database calls with caching logic.]

Monitoring: Recommend monitoring cache hit/miss ratio and latency.
